LDAP server for Aleph integrated library system. This ldap server is used in Moravian Library in Brno (http://www.mzk.cz) for authentication purposes (Shibboleth, SafeQ, MAC OS, Linux, Samba). It translates simple LDAP queries to equivalent SQL queries according to Aleph Oracle DB schema and then it uses X-Server to fetch additional information about user or to apply attribute filter policy. There is no need for external LDAP database, but you can use OpenLDAP as a proxy, if you need to run your LDAP on privelleged standard port 389 or 686. This script is intended to be run under non-privelleged user account.

We are investigating the possibility of replication of Aleph Oracle DB to OpenLDAP with the use of SQL triggers and periodical updates because of limitation this solution (no support for replication, only basic queries are supported, ..).
